# Applied Bioinformatics – ESBOE2116

This repository contains the teaching materials for the course **Applied Bioinformatics (ESBOE2116)**.  
It is designed to guide students step by step from **setting up their working environment** to **basic genomics data analysis on Linux and HPC systems**.

The content is intentionally progressive and should be followed **in the order described below**.

---

## Purpose of the Repository

The main objectives of this repository are to help students:

- Set up a **Linux working environment** on Windows using WSL
- Learn to use the **Linux command line**
- Understand how bioinformatics analyses are organized in practice
- Get familiar with **genomics pre-analysis workflows**
- Use a **high-performance computing (HPC) cluster** for bioinformatics tasks

This repository is intended for **students with little or no prior experience in Linux or bioinformatics**.

## Repository Structure & Recommended Order

Please follow the materials **in the following order**.

### 1. Installing WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

**Installation of WSL**

This document explains how to install and configure:
- WSL 2 on Windows 11
- Ubuntu Linux
- A functional Linux terminal environment

This step is **mandatory** for Windows users before continuing.

---

### 2. Learning the Linux Command Line

**Learning the linux command line.md**

This section introduces:
- Basic Linux commands (`ls`, `cd`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, etc.)
- File and directory manipulation
- Permissions and paths
- Command-line best practices

This part is essential for understanding all subsequent bioinformatics scripts.

---

### 3. Introduction to Genomics Pre-assembly

**Genomics_preassembly.md**

This document covers:
- Basic concepts in genomics data analysis
- Pre-assembly steps (quality control, data preparation)
- Typical file formats used in genomics (FASTQ, FASTA, etc.)

This section connects Linux skills with **real bioinformatics data**.

---

### 4. Working on an HPC Cluster

**The CECI cluster.md**

This section introduces:
- High-performance computing concepts
- Connecting to a remote cluster
- Job submission and resource management
- Running bioinformatics analyses on shared infrastructure

This is the final step, preparing students for **real-world bioinformatics workflows**.

---

## 5. How to Use This Repository

- Read the documents **in order**
- Execute commands on your own machine when instructed
- Do not skip steps, even if they seem simple
- Ask questions and experiment — mistakes are part of learning

---

## 6. Recommended Tools

- **Windows Terminal**
- **Ubuntu (WSL 2)**
- **Visual Studio Code**
  - Extension: *Remote – WSL*

---

## 7. Prerequisites

- Basic computer literacy
- No prior Linux or bioinformatics experience required
- Curiosity and willingness to practice

---
