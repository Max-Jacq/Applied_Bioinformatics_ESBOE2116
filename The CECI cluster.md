# 1.The CECI cluster

For this session, we will be working on a computer cluster. <br>
A cluster is a set of machines that allows an access to thousands of cores at the <br>
same time and a huge memory capacity. Clusters are extremely interesting to <br>
merge resources that would be otherwise inaccessible or too expensive. Cluster <br>
also allow a range of programs and environments preinstalled easily accessible <br>
to anyone. <br>
To access the cluster, users will go through a gateway and share the <br>
computational resources. That is why it is important to avoid running heavy jobs <br>
directly on the cluster interface as it will impact the other users. To manage and <br>
run the scripts, the cluster usually rely on a job scheduler (SLURM, QSUB etc.) <br>
with how many CPUs and memory it will need for a specific job. <br>
The cluster available is named CÉCI, for 'Consortium des Équipements de <br> 
Calcul Intensif'. CÉCI is thus a consortium which gathers all supercomputing <br>
centers from the universities in Fédération Wallonie-Bruxelles, namely <br>
Université libre de Bruxelles, Université catholique de Louvain, Université de <br>
Liège, Université de Mons, and Université de Namur <br>
